## In this project, the data from Telegram chat were uploaded and statistically analyzed by the following metrics:
- Who wrote the most in the chat room?
- Top 10 "responders"
- How mutual was it? 
- At what hour of the day are chatters historically the most chatting?
- What day has there been the highest decrease in chat messages as a % of the previous day?
